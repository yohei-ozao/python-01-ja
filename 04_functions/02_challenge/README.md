# Challenge 2 (Live)

Unicode is a computing industry standard designed to consistently represent and manipulate text expressed in most of the world's writing systems. It provides a unique number, known as a Unicode code point, for every character, regardless of the computing platform, application, or language.

Create a program that encodes and decodes a message given by a user as input. Follow these steps:

- Create the `encode` function. The `encode` function should iterate over each character in the list and replaces it with its unicode value. In order to obtain the unicode value of each character, you'll need to use the `ord()` built-in function.

- Create the `decode` function. The `decode` function should iterate over the sequence of unicode numbers generated by `encode` and convert them back to characters. In order to obtain the character value of each unicode number, you'll need to use the `chr()` built-in function.

Do your research on how to use `ord` and `chr` and make sure your program handles edge cases like empty input.

Examples
```python
encode("Hello World")  # 72 101 108 108 111 32 119 111 114 108 100
```

```python
decode("72 101 108 108 111 32 119 111 114 108 100")  # Hello World
```
